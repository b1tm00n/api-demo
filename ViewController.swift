// NOTE: (Ted)  Most of iOS app development is about asking a simple question.
//              What happens if I don't have X?
//
//              Writing code is usually some form of methodically stepping through all of the things
//              that might not go the way you want them to, and making sure you handle that scenario.
//
//              In this app, a few things can go wrong, and we need to handle those things gracefully.
//
//              1. What if the developer didn't hook up the IBOutlets?
//              2. What if they did hook up the outlets, but there's no text entered when someone hits the submit button?
//              3. What if the text they entered is a valid city, but no results are returned? What do you display?
//
//              And so on.
//
//              Always keep asking "what does this do when things don't go well?" and then make sure there's some logic for it.

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    // NOTE: (Ted)  I prefer to do these as plain optionals to give you more control over what happens if there is no underlying value at the time they are
    //              accessed.
    //
    //              For example, you can do a thing called an assertionFailure which makes it so the app will crash in a debug build but
    //              won't crash in a production build.
    //
    //              Then you can define a separate behavior for a production build that keeps the user going without crashing the app (if it's appropriate).
    //
    //              Lots of dumb people think crashing is always the worst thing that can happen in an app. It's NOT! Crashing is a system behavior specifically
    //              designed to prevent a far worse outcome, namely data corruption. Also, crashing can help you find where a problem occurs since the debugger will
    //              take you straight to the line of code with the problem.

        //              the variables appear as plain non-optional instances after this statement.
        //
        //              I generally prefer to unwrap all the optional stuff up front. Then I know I'm dealing with plain variables downstream.
        //              It's much easier to reason about things when you know they definitely have a value. It also simplifies the code following the
        //              point where you do the unwrapping. From that point forward, there are no surprises.

            //              App Store. It's an uncommon scenario, since you'll probably find the problem in a debug build,
            //              but technically it can happen.
